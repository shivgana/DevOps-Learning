<p>What are two characteristics of the public cloud deployment model? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.</p>
<h4 id="correct-answer">Correct Answer</h4>
<ul>
<li>Servers and storage are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider.</li>
<li>Services are offered over the internet and are available to anyone who wants to purchase them.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In a public cloud, services are offered over the internet and are available to anyone who wants to purchase them. A private cloud is limited to a single organization. Cloud resources, such as servers and storage, are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and delivered over the internet. A private cloud consists of computing resources used exclusively by users from one business or organization.</p>

<p>Which cloud service model provides you with the most control over the hardware that runs applications?</p>
<h4 id="correct-answer-8">Correct Answer</h4>
<ul>
<li>infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>IaaS is the most flexible category of cloud services. It aims to give you complete control over the hardware that runs applications. Users do not control the operating system and do not configure the underlying servers in PaaS. With SaaS, you are using as-is software hosted in the cloud, instead of creating a platform to host a software yourself.</p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>SaaS is software that is centrally hosted and managed for you and your users or customers. Usually, one version of the application is used for all customers, and it is licensed through a monthly or annual subscription. PaaS and IaaS use a consumption-based model, so you only pay for what you use.</p>

<h3 id="question-11">Question 11</h3>
<p>Your organization is building a custom application.<br>
You need to focus on application development rather than configuration and management of servers.<br>
Which cloud service model should you use?</p>
<h4 id="correct-answer-10">Correct Answer</h4>
<ul>
<li>platform as a service (PaaS)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>With PaaS, users can focus on application development because the cloud provider handles all the platform management. In SaaS, the cloud provider manages all aspects of the application environment, such as virtual machines, networking resources, data storage, and applications. IaaS is the closest service model to managing physical servers.</p>
