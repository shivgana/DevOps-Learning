<p>You have a Microsoft Entra tenant named <a href="http://contoso.com">contoso.com</a>. Microsoft Entra Connect is configured to sync users to the tenant.<br>
You need to assign licenses to the users based on Microsoft Entra ID attributes. The solution must minimize administrative effort.<br>
Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.</p>
<h3 id="correct-answer-50">Correct Answer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Assign the licenses to the dynamic groups.</li>
<li>Create dynamic groups.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>To assign licenses to users based on Microsoft Entra ID attributes, you must create a dynamic security group and configure rules based on custom attributes. The dynamic group must be added to a license group for automatic synchronization. All users in the groups will get the license automatically. Microsoft Entra evaluates the users in the organization that are in scope for an assignment policy rule and creates assignments for the users who don’t have assignments to an access package; automatic assignment policies are not used for licensing.</p>

<p>You have an Azure virtual network that contains two subnets named Subnet1 and Subnet2. You have a virtual machine named VM1 that is connected to Subnet1. VM1 runs Windows Server.<br>
You need to ensure that VM1 is connected directly to both subnets.<br>
What should you do first?</p>
<h3 id="correct-answer-62">Correct Answer</h3>
<ul>
<li>From the Azure portal, add a network interface.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A network interface is used to connect a virtual machine to a subnet. Since VM1 is connected to Subnet1, VM1 already has a network interface attached that is connected to Subnet1. To connect VM1 directly to Subnet2, you must create a new network interface that is connected to Subnet2. Next, you must attach the new network interface to VM1.<br>
An IP group is a user-defined collection of static IP addresses, ranges, and subnets. A network bridge allows you to connect multiple existing network connection in Windows together. Changing the IP configurations of the existing network interface results in VM1 being connected to Subnet2 but not to Subnet1.</p>

<p>You have an Azure virtual network named VNet1 that is deployed to the Azure East US region.<br>
You need to ensure that email is sent to an administrator when a virtual machine is connected to VNet1.<br>
What should you create?</p>
<h3 id="correct-answer-74">Correct Answer</h3>
<ul>
<li>an action group</li>
<li>an alert rule</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues in the system before customers notice them. You can set alerts on metrics, logs, and the activity log. Different types of alerts have benefits and drawbacks. Metrics is a feature of Azure Monitor that collects numeric data from monitored resources into a time-series database. Metrics are numerical values that are collected at regular intervals and describe some aspect of a system at a particular time.<br>
When Azure Monitor data indicates that there may be an issue with an infrastructure or application, an alert is triggered. Azure Monitor, Azure Service Health, and Azure Advisor then use action groups to notify users about the alert and take action. An action group is a collection of notification preferences defined by the owner of an Azure subscription.</p>
