<p>You have an Azure virtual network that contains two subnets named Subnet1 and Subnet2. You have a virtual machine named VM1 that is connected to Subnet1. VM1 runs Windows Server.<br>
You need to ensure that VM1 is connected directly to both subnets.<br>
What should you do first?</p>
<h5 id="correct-answer-62">Correct Answer</h5>
<ul>
<li>From the Azure portal, add a network interface.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A network interface is used to connect a virtual machine to a subnet. Since VM1 is connected to Subnet1, VM1 already has a network interface attached that is connected to Subnet1. To connect VM1 directly to Subnet2, you must create a new network interface that is connected to Subnet2. Next, you must attach the new network interface to VM1.<br>
An IP group is a user-defined collection of static IP addresses, ranges, and subnets. A network bridge allows you to connect multiple existing network connection in Windows together. Changing the IP configurations of the existing network interface results in VM1 being connected to Subnet2 but not to Subnet1.</p>

<p>You have an Azure virtual network named VNet1 that is deployed to the Azure East US region.<br>
You need to ensure that email is sent to an administrator when a virtual machine is connected to VNet1.<br>
What should you create?</p>
<h5 id="correct-answer-74">Correct Answer</h5>
<ul>
<li>an action group</li>
<li>an alert rule</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues in the system before customers notice them. You can set alerts on metrics, logs, and the activity log. Different types of alerts have benefits and drawbacks. Metrics is a feature of Azure Monitor that collects numeric data from monitored resources into a time-series database. Metrics are numerical values that are collected at regular intervals and describe some aspect of a system at a particular time.<br>
When Azure Monitor data indicates that there may be an issue with an infrastructure or application, an alert is triggered. Azure Monitor, Azure Service Health, and Azure Advisor then use action groups to notify users about the alert and take action. An action group is a collection of notification preferences defined by the owner of an Azure subscription.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>IP flow verify lets you specify a source and destination IPv4 address, port, protocol (TCP or UDP), and traffic direction (inbound or outbound). IP flow verify can identify the specific network security group (NSG) that prevents communication. NSG flow logs is a feature of Azure Network Watcher that allows you to log information about IP traffic flowing through an NSG. Although the logs may help you identify the source of the issue, it requires much more configuration and manual evaluation. Packet capture allows you to create packet capture sessions to track traffic to and from a virtual machine. Packet capture may help narrow down the scope of the issue, but it will not identify the specific N3G that prevents communication.</p>

<p>You are responsible for setting up Azure DNS for your organization’s primary domain “<a href="http://example.com">example.com</a>”. Which record type would you set up to ensure that <a href="http://mail.example.com">mail.example.com</a> points to your mail server’s IP address?</p>
<h4 id="correct-answer-163">Correct answer</h4>
<ul>
<li>A record</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>a. An “A” record maps a domain name to the IP address (IPv4) of the computer hosting the domain. It uses the domain name to find the IP address of a computer connected to the internet. In this case, we want <a href="http://mail.example.com">mail.example.com</a> to point directly to an IP address of your mail server.<br>
b. A CNAME (Canonical Name) record is a type of DNS record that maps an alias name to a true or canonical domain name. CNAME records are typically used to map a subdomain such as  <code>www</code>  or  <code>mail</code>  to the domain hosting that subdomain’s content.<br>
c. The MX (Mail Exchange) record is crucial for directing email to your domain, but it doesn’t directly map to an IP address like the A or AAAA records. Instead, it points to a domain name (usually a subdomain like “<a href="http://mail.example.com">mail.example.com</a>”).<br>
d. In Azure DNS, you can create a TXT record for various purposes. For example, you might need to create a TXT record to verify that you own the domain you want to add to Microsoft 365. Or, you might need to create a TXT record to validate a custom domain for your app service.</p>

<h3 id="question-26-1">Question 26</h3>
<p>Let’s examine the following situation:.<br>
<strong>The resource group</strong>  includes:<br>
· Virtual Machine A<br>
· Storage account B<br>
· Virtual network C</p>
<p><strong>You are trying to deploy the below resource using the ARM template</strong>:<br>
· Network security group D</p>
<p>Below is the PowerShell cmdlet you are using to deploy the template.<br>
<code>New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -Mode Complete -Name ExampleDeployment -ResourceGroupName ExampleResourceGroup -TemplateFile c:\MyTemplates\storage.json</code><br>
As you can see in the above cmdlet, we are using mode as complete. When deploying resources with Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates), you have two options for deployment mode: incremental or complete. What will happen if we use mode as complete?</p>
<h4 id="correct-answer-215">Correct answer</h4>
<ul>
<li>Resource Manager  <strong>deletes</strong>  resources in the resource group that aren’t specified in the template. – that means virtual machine A, Storage account B, Virtual Network C will be deleted since these are not defined in ARM template.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In complete mode, the Resource Manager  <strong>deletes</strong>  resources in the resource group that aren’t specified in the template.<br>

<p>Adding a group to an administrative unit brings the group itself into the management scope of the administrative unit, but not the members of the group. In other words, an administrator scoped to the administrative unit can manage properties of the group, such as group name or membership, but they cannot manage properties of the users or devices within that group (unless those users and devices are separately added as members of the administrative unit). Since Godfred is part of group2, that means the admin won’t be able to manage the user Godfred as he is not the direct user added to the administrative unit.</p>

This entire setup was part of a testing project. Your testing is done, and you are trying to delete the resource group, Prod-RG1, but deletion fails.<br>
What should you do first?</p>
<h4 id="correct-answer-239">Correct answer</h4>
<ul>
<li>Stop the backup of Prod-SQLDB01</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>You can’t delete a vault that contains protected data sources (for example, IaaS VMs, SQL databases, or Azure file shares).<br>
You can’t delete a vault that contains backup data. Once backup data is deleted, it will go into the soft deleted state.<br>
You can’t delete a vault that contains backup data in the soft deleted state.<br>
You can’t delete a vault that has registered storage accounts.<br>

<p>Your company has a Microsoft Azure subscription. The company has datacenters in Los Angeles and New York. You are configuring the two datacenters as geo-clustered sites for site resiliency.<br>
You need to recommend an Azure storage redundancy option. You have the following data storage requirements:<br>
Data must be stored on multiple nodes.<br>
Data must be stored on nodes in separate geographic locations.<br>
Data can be read from the secondary location as well as from the primary location.<br>
Which of the following Azure stored redundancy options should you recommend?</p>
<h4 id="correct-answer-277">Correct answer</h4>
<ul>
<li>RA-GRS (Read only geo-redundant storage)</li>
</ul>

<p>Your company has three virtual machines (VMs) that are included in an availability set.<br>
You try to resize one of the VMs, which returns an allocation failure message.<br>
It is imperative that the VM is resized.<br>
Which of the following actions should you take?</p>
<h4 id="correct-answer-278">Correct answer</h4>
<ul>
<li>You should stop all three VMs.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If the VM you wish to resize is part of an availability set, then you must stop all VMs in the availability set before changing the size of any VM in the availability set.<br>
The reason all VMs in the availability set must be stopped before performing the resize operation to a size that requires different hardware is that all running VMs in the availability set must be using the same physical hardware cluster.</p>

<p>What is the likely reason for the failure of the resize operation when you try to change the VM1’s size from Standard_D4s_v3 to Standard_D2s_v3 in Azure.<br>
Considering VM1’s properties</p>
<pre><code>Number of virtual CPUs : 2
Storage type: Premium
Number of data disks: 6
Public IP address: Standard SKU
</code></pre>
<h4 id="correct-answer-282">Correct answer</h4>
<ul>
<li>Number of data disk</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In this scenario, the virtual machine (VM) resize failure is caused by the VM’s current number of data disks. The Standard_D4s_v3 instance size supports up to eight data disks, but the Standard D2s_v3 instance size only supports up to four data disks. Therefore, you will be unable to make the VM size reduction unless you detach the extra data disks from the VM.</p>

The solution must ensure that the groups are deleted automatically after 180 days. Which two groups should you create? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.<br>
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.</p>
<h4 id="correct-answer-284">Correct answer</h4>
<ul>
<li>A Microsoft 365 group that uses the Dynamic User membership type.</li>
<li>A Microsoft 365 group that uses the Assigned membership type.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>You can set an expiration policy only for Office 365 groups in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Note: With the increase in usage of Office 365 Groups, administrators and users need a way to clean up unused groups. Expiration policies can help remove inactive groups from the system and make things cleaner. When a group expires, all its associated services (the mailbox, planner, SharePoint site, etc.) are also deleted. You can set up a rule for dynamic membership in security groups or Office 365 groups.</p>
